# docs-scraper

This is a basic .NET (Framework, not tested under .NET Core) library to load documentation articles from the internet.

Currenly the only implementation is for the Zoho KB. Just enter the URL of the KB where a list of links are and it will download all the articles so you can put them in a database for local usage (eg, allow the user to search for them in your site).

Check the Tests for example usage.
